<i>Note: The config file will be created automatically.</i>

## How to use
1. When you open the application, you will need to select the map where the lineup will be used. If there are no maps, you will have to create the folders as in the last image and reopen the program.
To select an option, click on it with the primary mouse button.<br/><br/>

<i>Note: The resolution of the final image is the same as your monitor. It's recommended to have a better crosshair than the example images to see more clearly the position. If you have more than one monitor, the screenshots will be taken on the main monitor.</i>
